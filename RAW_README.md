  <strong>Embodied-Navigator Overview: Model Architecture and Experimental Results</strong>
</p>

## Overview

Embodied-Navigator is a unified vision-language navigation framework that aligns high-level visual reasoning with low-level physical execution. Instead of asking a vision-language model (VLM) to regress 3D coordinates or emit long sequences of atomic actions, Embodied-Navigator lets the model act as a visual pointer: it selects a camera view and a 2D pixel waypoint, which is projected into 3D and executed by a low-level SLAM controller.

The framework couples this vision-centric action space with selective reasoning, long-horizon memory, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. The resulting RGB-based navigator reasons at difficult decision points, preserves the topology of long trajectories, and learns from both immediate physical feedback and complete-task outcomes.

> **Core contribution:** Embodied-Navigator unifies spatial alignment, adaptive reasoning, compact trajectory memory, and dense policy optimization in one embodied navigation framework.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/img/architecture.png" alt="Embodied-Navigator architecture" width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center"><em>
Embodied-Navigator combines multi-view RGB observations, language instructions, Anchor-Trajectory Memory, selective reasoning, visual waypoint prediction, and 2D-to-3D execution.
</em></p>

At each navigation step, the policy combines four egocentric RGB views with a compressed history. It decides whether the scene warrants explicit reasoning, predicts a view and pixel waypoint, and delegates metric execution to the controller. Depth is used only after the VLM prediction for geometric projection; it is not an input to the VLM.

| Component | Mechanism | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Point** | For the first time, use pixel pointing as a bridge from VLM pre-training to VLN, then project the selected pixel into 3D | Smoothly transfers pretrained visual-grounding ability into VLN while leaving geometry and motion control to deterministic modules |
| **Think** | Trigger Chain-of-Thought only at critical topological nodes | Concentrates computation on crossroads, doorways, and target-relevant decisions |
| **Memorize** | Store critical states as visual-reasoning anchors and routine motion as Space-Time Indicators | Preserves long-horizon topology without retaining every visual frame |
| **Align** | Optimize the policy through reinforcement learning with Two-Level GRPO, combining local action and global trajectory advantages | Assigns credit from immediate decisions to final navigation success |

### Point: visual actions, metric execution

Embodied-Navigator is the first to formulate pixel pointing as a natural bridge for smoothly transferring the VLM's visual-grounding ability acquired during pre-training to VLN. The VLM observes four views covering 360 degrees, chooses the most relevant view, and predicts a pixel coordinate. Projecting that pixel through the aligned depth map produces a local 3D waypoint for the SLAM controller. This separation lets the learned policy focus on visual-semantic grounding rather than learning metric geometry implicitly.

### Think and Memorize: adaptive cognition over long horizons

Embodied-Navigator treats reasoning events as memory anchors. A critical node retains its visual evidence, spatial-temporal state, and reasoning summary. Between anchors, redundant images are discarded and the traversed path is represented by lightweight Space-Time Indicators encoding position, orientation, and time. The resulting alternating anchor-trajectory sequence preserves both semantic landmarks and geometric connectivity.

### Align: Two-Level GRPO

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/img/two_level_grpo.png" alt="Two-Level GRPO with step-level and trajectory-level rollouts" width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center"><em>
Two-Level GRPO is a reinforcement-learning objective that superimposes local action advantages and global trajectory advantages across multi-branch rollouts.
</em></p>

At every decision point, the policy explores several candidate visual actions and receives local feedback. Complete rollouts receive global feedback for success, path efficiency, and reasoning density. Combining both levels reduces the credit-assignment gap between a final outcome and the intermediate decisions that produced it.

| Optimization level | Signals | What it teaches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Local step** | Target approach, collision avoidance, stop correctness, reasoning value, output validity | Which action and reasoning choice is useful at the current state |
| **Global trajectory** | Task success, SPL, reasoning density | Whether the complete plan is successful, efficient, and cognitively economical |
| **Combined advantage** | Global advantage + local advantage | How local decisions contribute to long-term navigation quality |

## Main Results

All values below are reported in the manuscript on validation-unseen splits. Higher is better for OS, SR, SPL, and nDTW; lower is better for NE.

### R2R-CE Val-Unseen

| Method | NE (lower) | OS | SR | SPL |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| StreamVLN | 4.98 | 64.2 | 56.9 | 51.9 |
| NavFoM | 4.61 | 72.1 | 61.7 | 55.3 |
| DualVLN | 4.05 | 70.7 | 64.3 | 58.5 |
| Embodied-Navigator (SFT only) | 4.88 | 62.0 | 55.7 | 50.3 |
| **Embodied-Navigator** | **3.85** | **74.5** | **66.2** | **58.8** |

### RxR-CE Val-Unseen

| Method | NE (lower) | SR | SPL | nDTW |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| StreamVLN | 6.22 | 52.9 | 46.0 | 61.9 |
| NavFoM | 4.74 | 64.4 | 56.2 | 65.8 |
| DualVLN | 4.58 | 61.4 | 51.8 | 70.0 |
| Embodied-Navigator (SFT only) | 6.10 | 52.4 | 46.2 | 62.1 |
| **Embodied-Navigator** | **4.32** | **65.7** | **56.9** | **72.4** |

The full framework improves R2R-CE success from **55.7% to 66.2%** over its SFT-only initialization, a gain of 10.5 percentage points from reinforcement-learning alignment.

## What The Model Learns

### Reasoning on demand

| Trigger strategy | CoT ratio | R2R-CE SR |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Dense CoT | 100.0% | 66.8% |
| Fixed interval (1/3) | 36.2% | 60.1% |
| **Adaptive trigger (Embodied-Navigator)** | **26.3%** | **66.2%** |

Adaptive triggering nearly matches dense reasoning while invoking CoT on roughly one quarter of the steps. Spatial analysis further shows that reasoning assigned to straight corridors falls from **38% after SFT to 11% after RL alignment**, while triggers concentrate around intersections, doorways, and target-relevant regions.

### Long-horizon memory

The long-horizon subset contains 5,927 trajectories whose expert paths exceed 12.5 meters.

| Memory or navigation variant | SR |
| --- | ---: |
| StreamVLN | 30.9 |
| DualVLN | 41.9 |
| Embodied-Navigator with uniform sampling | 40.5 |
| Embodied-Navigator with full history | 42.4 |
| Embodied-Navigator without Space-Time Indicators | 45.6 |
| **Embodied-Navigator with Anchor-Trajectory Memory** | **49.8** |

Explicit anchors preserve high-value semantic evidence, while Space-Time Indicators retain the geometry of compressed path segments. Removing the indicators reduces long-horizon SR by 4.2 percentage points.

### Controlled component attribution

All variants below use the same Qwen2.5-VL-7B policy, sensing inputs, validation-unseen splits, fixed non-learned SLAM controller, and evaluation protocol. Each block changes only its named component. R2R-CE values are ordered as **NE / OS / SR / SPL**; RxR-CE values are **NE / SR / SPL / nDTW**.

| Block | Variant | R2R-CE | RxR-CE |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Action (SFT only) | NavFoM-style metric waypoint | 7.18 / 42.0 / 30.9 / 24.7 | 8.47 / 27.2 / 20.6 / 43.1 |
|  | **Pixel-to-3D** | **4.88 / 62.0 / 55.7 / 50.3** | **6.10 / 52.4 / 46.2 / 62.1** |
| GRPO | Global trajectory advantage only | 4.52 / 67.0 / 59.3 / 52.1 | 5.30 / 58.4 / 49.7 / 65.5 |
|  | Two-Level without annealed guidance | 4.12 / 71.5 / 63.4 / 56.0 | 4.72 / 62.6 / 53.8 / 69.4 |
|  | **Full Two-Level GRPO** | **3.85 / 74.5 / 66.2 / 58.8** | **4.32 / 65.7 / 56.9 / 72.4** |
| Memory | Uniform sampling | 4.43 / 68.2 / 60.8 / 53.6 | 5.03 / 59.4 / 50.8 / 66.8 |
|  | Full history | 4.29 / 69.4 / 61.9 / 54.7 | 4.87 / 61.1 / 51.8 / 68.0 |
|  | AT-Mem without STI | 4.08 / 71.4 / 63.6 / 56.1 | 4.59 / 62.4 / 52.7 / 69.8 |
|  | **Full AT-Mem** | **3.85 / 74.5 / 66.2 / 58.8** | **4.32 / 65.7 / 56.9 / 72.4** |
| Reasoning | Dense CoT | 3.79 / 75.1 / 66.8 / 59.3 | 4.25 / 66.1 / 57.4 / 72.8 |
|  | Fixed interval (1/3) | 4.46 / 67.6 / 60.1 / 52.8 | 5.10 / 58.9 / 50.0 / 65.9 |
|  | **Adaptive (ours)** | **3.85 / 74.5 / 66.2 / 58.8** | **4.32 / 65.7 / 56.9 / 72.4** |

The controlled action study uses the same 90k trajectories, approximately 700k interactions, and one SFT epoch without GRPO. Pixel-to-3D improves SR by **24.8/25.2 points** on R2R-CE/RxR-CE. Within GRPO, local advantages add **4.1/4.2 points**, and annealed guidance adds another **2.8/3.1 points**.

### MultiNav-CoT supervision study

All variants use the same 90k trajectories, action labels, Qwen2.5-VL-7B student, and one-epoch SFT budget without GRPO; only the CoT supervision source changes.

| SFT supervision | R2R-CE: NE / OS / SR / SPL | RxR-CE: NE / SR / SPL / nDTW |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Action only (no CoT) | 5.31 / 57.0 / 50.6 / 45.0 | 6.71 / 46.1 / 39.8 / 56.2 |
| Qwen2.5-VL-7B CoT | 5.46 / 55.7 / 49.4 / 43.1 | 6.83 / 44.8 / 38.2 / 54.9 |
| GLM-4.5V-108B CoT | 4.99 / 60.8 / 54.4 / 48.9 | 6.24 / 51.2 / 44.9 / 60.8 |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash CoT** | **4.88 / 62.0 / 55.7 / 50.3** | **6.10 / 52.4 / 46.2 / 62.1** |

Weak CoT supervision falls below action-only SFT, while the open-weight GLM-4.5V-108B teacher approaches Gemini 2.5 Flash on both benchmarks.

### Efficiency, robustness, and transfer

| Evaluation | Embodied-Navigator | Comparison or reference |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Training scale | **90k trajectories / 700k interactions** | SFT cold start followed by Two-Level GRPO |
| Average policy interactions per trajectory | **9** | Approximately 30 for StreamVLN and DualVLN |
| Average inference time per task on one A800 | **16.58 s** | 37.47 s for StreamVLN; 41.46 s for DualVLN |
| SR with 0.2 multiplicative depth noise | **63.4%** | 66.2% without noise |
| Zero-shot real-world SR over 100 trials | **60.0%** | 49.0% for StreamVLN; 53.0% for DualVLN |

### Analysis: adaptive cognition, memory, and alignment

  </tr>
</table>

The three views isolate distinct claims. RL alignment reduces reasoning assigned to straight corridors from **38% to 11%** and concentrates triggers near consequential nodes. Embodied-Navigator retains the strongest success rate across the plotted trajectory-length bins, while removing Space-Time Indicators reduces aggregate long-horizon SR by **4.2 points**. Two-Level GRPO reaches about **0.68** success reward during training; local step advantages and annealed guided sampling provide a clear advantage over trajectory-only feedback.
